## What I Learned

- In **non-SPA apps**, adding a note triggers a **full page reload** and multiple resource fetches  
  → see **[Exercise 0.4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8213c9cc-73ac-47da-968a-8d0d9165e2ed)**

- In **SPAs**, the browser sends a **single API request** and updates the UI via JavaScript  
  → see **[Exercise 0.6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edc27c33-19d2-4198-b07f-a5cbce96b505)**
